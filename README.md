# EarthEngineToGeoTIFF
A simple python script to download a map from Google's Earth Engine and save as a GeoTIFF file.

The script will download an RGB image from the Sentinal S2 Surface Reflectance satellite, but this could be changed fairly easily by modifying the ImageCollection in EarthEngineToGeoTIFF.py.
