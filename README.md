# EarthEngineToGeoTIFF
A simple Python script to download a map from Google's Earth Engine and save as a GeoTIFF file.

The script will download an RGB image from the Sentinal S2 Surface Reflectance satellite, but this could be changed fairly easily by modifying the ImageCollection in EarthEngineToGeoTIFF.py.

See [this blog post](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/2021/11/19/downloading-satellite-images-made-easy/) for a description of the code and how to use it.
